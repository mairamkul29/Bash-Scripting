# Descriptions:
I want a small program to locate my repository I want to
work on and take me there. It should also prevent from silly
errors.

Step 1:
First we locate our repository using the build-in
linux command "find".

Step 2:
Take input as $1 to locate a specific repository 
If there is no input , we will print out error messsage.

Step 3:
We will save the output of the "find" command and
"change directory" to the repository

Step 4:
Before the bash process is eliminated, we take over.
